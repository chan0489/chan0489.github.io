                <p>
                    <span>Hello</span>, my name is <em>Zoe</em> and I am 18. I was born in Hong Kong, and I had just
                    graduated
                    from
                    high school.
                    This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in Canada. Currently, I am studying the <abbr
                        title="Interative Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College.
                    My goal at this moment is to get good grades in college.
                    My life motto is <em><strong><q>There's a will there's a way!</q></strong></em> <sup>1</sup>
                    I believe that once you put your mind and effort into doing something, you will reach your goal
                    eventually.

                <p>
                    I love reading books, swimming and doing yoga in my spare time. <em><strong><q>To spend time is to
                                pass
                                it in a
                                specified manner. To waste time is to expend it thoughtlessly or carelessly. We all have
                                time to
                                either spend or waste and it is our decision what to do with it. But once passed, it is
                                gone
                                forever.</q></strong></em> <sup>2</sup> This motto helps me change my habit, which I try
                    not
                    to waste my time on
                    trivial pursuits!
