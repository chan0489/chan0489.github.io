            <hr>
            <p>
                <span>Hello</span>, I am <em>Zoe</em> and I am 18. I was born in Hong Kong, and I had just graduated from high school.
              This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in Canada. Currently, I am studying the <abbr title="Interative Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. 
              My goal at this moment is to get good grades in college.
               My life motto is <q>There's a will there's a way!</q> <sup>1</sup> I believe that once you put your mind and effort into doing something, you will reach your goal eventually.
            </p>

                   I love reading books, swimming and doing yoga in my spare time. <q>To spend time is to pass it in a specified manner. To waste time is to expend it thoughtlessly or carelessly. We all have time to either spend or waste and it is our decision what to do with it. But once passed, it is gone forever.</q> <sup>2</sup> This motto helps me change my habit, which I try not to waste my time on trivial pursuits!
